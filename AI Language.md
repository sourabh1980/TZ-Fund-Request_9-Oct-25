The members of the teams are beneficiaries
So now , you can take these headers the values below them 

Definitions : 

Indexing: The headers mentioned above and the values beneath them like beneficiaries dates span , mobile numbers etc are to be indexed in a way that when user starts writing , the predictive text starts coming and when the text entered is matching with these indexed words, they act as an inputs .

Predictive text: 

Calendar widget: By calendar widget I mean a beautiful calendar UI when open , user can be able to select two dates in it . The lower date will be From date and To date will be larger date. The in-between dates to be highlighted. When user clicks apply, the dates to be mentioned in chat editor and this will be From and To dates I.e. the time span the data to be filtered and show to the user based on other inputs also as well.

In Chat: i want user to select the From and To dates by calendar UI, when user write To/From on screen, calendar widget to open (functionality explain above) .

In chat: whenever user types anything , the chat system to give predictive text options (see Indexing above ) .

In chat ; system or AI to club the inputs (indexed words) and analyse the data . In case the word is not indexed word, then system to use the intelligence to ask more interactive questions, understand which indexed word the user is meant and then analyse the data and give the answer.

If the user writes Output: it means user is asking for tabular response or figures response 

Than you can define standard mathematical operators like : add, compare, multiply, greater than , smaller than etc

Some points of clarities:
Do you want the typeahead to show values from all sheets immediately (beneficiary, project, team, vehicle) or limit to a selected type first (e.g., project-only)? All sheets
For date input: prefer calendar opening on typing the words from or to (case-insensitive) and on clicking a calendar icon — ok? Any additional trigger words? Case sensitive FROM or TO
When user types “Output:” do you want CSV-like tabular text, an HTML table, or both (HTML for UI, CSV for copy)? What i need to see a proper table in the chat , which user can be able to download also.
How should we handle mobile numbers in answers? Default: mask them (e.g., +255-XX-XXXX) unless explicitly requested by an admin. Confirm.: you will see the numbers like 078468322 , you need to consider them as +25578468322
Which math ops do you need immediately? (sum, avg, min, max, count, compare (> < =)) Any custom operators? You add whatever you can add
Expected size of the index (approx rows)? This determines caching/partial-indexing strategy. If unknown, I’ll implement a paged index and cache top N tokens. : See the same beneficiaries like 200 beneficiaries to be repeated in about 100,000 or more lines . Only their From and To dates and amounts, in some cases mob numbers will change
Do you prefer token chips UI (clickable tokens with removal) or only inline suggestions that complete text? Chips recommended for structured queries. Chips is ok , but i need that once the user has selected the chip, the selected chip (or word) to come as autocompete (predictive) to be highlighted in light pastel color as soon as user selects them and then a space to come 

In chat: Whenever user ask for any expense category like: Fuel, DA, Vehicle rent, Transport, Misc, etc and there is a time span mentioned in the query then, the system should check the date ranges not from the timestamp, but rather from the specific expense category (Fuel From/Fuel To, DA From/DA To, etc.). The Timestamp column is not used for metric-specific range questions unless explicitly specified by the user.
In Chat: I want to define that , whatever the user has selected the span like : Fuel From 1st Sept 2025 to 15 Sept 2025 ; but in data , the Fuel From and Fuel Date ranges are From 14th Aug 2025 to 10 Sept Sept 2025 and another range is 11th Sept 2025 to 21st Sept 2025. So which means no complete range is matching with the range defined by the user in chat. So in this case system to show all the ranges and the amounts in which the user mentioned dates are falling. 



couple of things i want to change:
1) This entire line i dont want: 💡 *Rate this response: Type "rate [1-5] conv_1757531099322" (1=poor, 5=excellent)*
rather , in the stars in the rating , put poor before first star and 5 after the fifth star
2) all this standard monthly expenses, fuel cost, beneficiary expenses , team expenses : standard queries shoud be removed
3) The mic icon to go below the send icon. 
4) The text when entering into the chat writing area, should be wrapped, right now text going out of the chat writing box. 
5) Highlight the color of the keywords like : fuel, Er da , transport , dates etc : The words matching the key words, to be shown in small pill of pastel color. And two consecutive keywords pastel color to be the same. once the keyword is selected , the keyword shown in the pastel color then, space to come between the pill and the text user enters next .


ok next is : I want to have a reply to the chat mechanism. Now, when i am sending query, i presume AI to make a cache of the data say a separate kinda table and then reply ot the user. Now , if the the user replies to this data , is it possible that by the use of AI the system smartly replies to the user. Then user can again reply to the answer and since the temporary cache of data is there , the AI or system can answer many questions from the set of data . Is this possible , a human like interaction from the same data cache till the time user replies  the same thread. Can we achieve with the use of AI API which we have integrated
